### Minisymposium info
- Title: Exploring Geometric Mechanics and Dynamics, Deterministic and Stochastic Perspectives.
- Organizers: Qiao Huang, Pingyuan Wei
- Description: This minisymposium delves into the intriguing and multifaceted field of geometric mechanics and dynamics, offering a comprehensive exploration of both deterministic and stochastic perspectives. The minisymposium aims to bring together researchers from various disciplines, including stochastic dynamics, geometric mechanics, mathematical physics, and beyond, to discuss recent advancements, theoretical insights, and practical applications in this vibrant field. Key topics to be covered include, but are not limited to:
  1. Deterministic/Stochastic mechanical systems: developments in modeling and analyzing differential equations that describe mechanical systems affiliated with sophisticated geometric structures or subject to random fluctuations and uncertainties;
  2. Stochastic/Random dynamical systems: investigating the behavior of dynamical systems under stochastic excitations/random impulses, with emphasis on stability, resonance phenomena, and long-term statistical properties;
  3. Applications in physics: case studies showcasing the application of stochastic mechanics principles in real-world scenarios, such as fluid dynamics, statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and the burgeoning field of AI.
  
  This minisymposium promises to be a platform for sharing cutting-edge research, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and driving forward the understanding and application of geometric mechanics and dynamics in deterministic and stochastic contexts.
- Confirmed speakers: Ying Chao, Qinbo Chen, Manuel de León, Francois Gay-Balmaz, Hongjun Gao, Qiao Huang, Xifeng Su, Pingyuan Wei, Yuancheng Xie, Jean-Claude Zambrini, Lei Zhang.
