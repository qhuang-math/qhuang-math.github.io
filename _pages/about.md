I am currently a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). Starting from Autumn 2024, I will be an associate researcher (副研究员) at Southeast University (SEU) in Nanjing, China. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, supervised by Prof. [Jinqiao Duan](https://jqduan.github.io/).

My research area is in stochastic dynamics and differential geometry.
