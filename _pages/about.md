I am currently an Associate Researcher (副研究员) at Southeast University (SEU) in Nanjing, China. Before joining SEU, I completed postdoctoral positions at the University of Lisbon in Portugal and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, under the supervision of Prof. [Jinqiao Duan](https://jqduan.github.io/).

My research area is in stochastic dynamics and differential geometry.
