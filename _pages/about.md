I am currently a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). Starting from August 2024, I will be an associate researcher (副研究员) at the Southeast University (SEU, 东南大学) in Nanjing, China. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST, 华中科技大学) in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, supervised by Prof. Jinqiao Duan.

My research area is in stochastic dynamics and differential geometry.
