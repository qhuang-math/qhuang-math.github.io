I am currently a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). Starting from August 2024, I will be an associate researcher at the Southeast University (SEU) in Nanjing, China. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, supervised by Prof. Jinqiao Duan.

My research area is in stochastic dynamics and differential geometry.
